                <p>The recent Novo1.0 tech meetup brought together some of the brightest minds in fintech, offering a glimpse into the future of finance and small business banking. The highlight of the event was undoubtedly the fintech panel, led by industry expert Sankar Rao Amburkar, which delved deep into cutting-edge topics such as UPI, blockchain, and digital currencies.</p>

                <h2>The Rise of UPI</h2>
                <p>Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has revolutionized digital payments in India, and the panel discussed its potential for global adoption. Sankar Rao Amburkar emphasized the simplicity and efficiency of UPI, stating, "UPI has democratized digital payments in India. Its success offers valuable lessons for other countries looking to streamline their payment systems."</p>

                <h2>Blockchain: Beyond Cryptocurrencies</h2>
                <p>The panel explored how blockchain technology is being applied beyond cryptocurrencies. From supply chain management to identity verification, the potential applications seem limitless. One panelist noted, "Blockchain's transparency and immutability make it a game-changer for industries requiring secure, traceable transactions."</p>

                <h2>The Future of Digital Currencies</h2>
                <p>With central banks worldwide exploring the possibility of issuing digital currencies, the panel discussed the implications for traditional banking and monetary policy. "Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could redefine the role of central banks and how monetary policy is implemented," explained a panelist from a leading financial institution.</p>

                <h2>Impact on Small Business Banking</h2>
                <p>The panel concluded by discussing how these technological advancements could benefit small businesses.
